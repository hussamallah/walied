STRIPE API KEYS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

You have LIVE Stripe keys, so you need to set them up properly:

1. CREATE .env.local FILE:
   Create a file called ".env.local" in the project root (same folder as package.json)
   
   Add this content:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

2. FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT:
   Go to your Vercel project dashboard:
   - Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add these two variables:
     * NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_live_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
     * STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

3. IMPORTANT:
   - These are LIVE keys (not test keys)
   - They will process REAL payments
   - Make sure your Stripe account is fully activated
   - Never share these keys publicly

4. TESTING:
   - Use real credit cards for testing (small amounts)
   - Or switch to test keys for development
