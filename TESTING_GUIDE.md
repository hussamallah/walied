## üß™ Testing Methods

### Method 1: Test Mode (RECOMMENDED - Safe Testing)

#### Step 1: Switch to Test Keys

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Make sure you're in **Test mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Get your test keys:
   - `pk_test_...` (Publishable key)
   - `sk_test_...` (Secret key)
4. Update `.env.local` with test keys
5. Restart your server

#### Step 2: Create Test Webhook (Optional - for local testing)

For local testing with Stripe CLI:
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/stripe-webhook
# Copy the webhook secret it shows (whsec_...)
# Add to .env.local
```

Or use your production webhook URL for testing on deployed site.

#### Step 3: Test the Payment Flow

1. **Start your site:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\oersonal coach\personal-coach-app"
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Site runs at: http://localhost:3001

2. **Go to Plans section** on your website

3. **Click "Subscribe Now"** on any plan (Basic, Gold, or Platinum)

4. **On Stripe Checkout page, use test card:**
   ```
   Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Expiry: 12/25 (any future date)
   CVC: 123 (any 3 digits)
   ZIP: 12345 (any ZIP)
   Name: Test Customer
   Email: your-email@example.com
   ```

5. **Complete the payment** - You'll be redirected back to your site

     - WhatsApp link

     üìã Training Code: TRAIN-XXXX

### Method 2: Live Mode Testing (ONLY if comfortable with real charges)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This uses REAL money!

1. Make sure you have **live keys** in `.env.local` and Vercel

3. Complete payment
4. Check email notification
5. You can refund the payment in Stripe Dashboard if needed:
   - Go to: Payments ‚Üí Find the payment ‚Üí Click ‚Üí Refund

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Payment Works But No Email?

1. **Check EmailJS configuration:**
   - Verify EmailJS credentials in `.env.local`
   - Check spam folder
   - Check EmailJS dashboard for sent emails

2. **Check webhook:**
   - Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
   - Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Check if events are being received
   - Check Vercel logs: Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs

3. **Check server logs:**
   - Vercel: Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs
   - Look for "Payment successful" or error messages

### Webhook Not Working?

1. **Verify webhook URL is correct:**
   ```
   https://coach-walid.vercel.app/api/stripe-webhook
   ```

2. **Check webhook secret:**
   - Must match exactly in Stripe Dashboard and `.env.local` / Vercel

3. **Test webhook manually:**
   - Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint ‚Üí "Send test webhook"
   - Select `checkout.session.completed`
   - Check server logs

### "Stripe secret key not configured"?

- Make sure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is in `.env.local` for local testing
